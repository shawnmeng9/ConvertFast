# ConvertFast
A tool for visualizing OpenFAST wind turbine geometries

This program is used for the visualization of OpenFAST models. Currently, the following OpenFAST modules are supported:

-AeroDyn

-ElastoDyn

-SubDyn

-HydroDyn

-MoorDyn

The Bentleyâ€™s iTwin Analytical Synchronizer (ISM) needs to be installed which is free to viewing. It can be downloaded here:

This program should directly be used by opening ConvertFast.exe in the zipped file, and the following video shows how to use it for visualizing OpenFAST geometries.

I know that there is a lot of work to do with this program. If you have any suggestions, or comments or find any bugs, please feel free to contact me (shawnmeng9@gmail.com). I sincerely appreciate it.

The following OpenFAST testing models have been tested and summarized in the following table:
